A snap for TunerStudio

## About
  TunerStudio MS, the most most advanced and refined MegaSquirt Tuning software available.
  The registered and Lite! editions are the same installer.

  After installing, run the following commands:
  
  `sudo snap connect tunerstudio:raw-usb`
  `sudo snap connect tunerstudio:removable-media`
  
  This is NOT an officially supported snap from TunerStudio. It is basically an automated
